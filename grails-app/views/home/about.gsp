				During our professional life we spend a lot of time looking for experts either for us, or because someone asked us, 
				if we know someone, who has knowledge about certain topics. This is not only a waste of time, it is also very 
				inefficient. Because:<br><br>
				<ul>
					<li>You cannot be sure that the person, you might consider an expert, is really the best choice. There might
					be better suited experts in the organisation, of whom you are not aware.</li>
					<li>The search can take a long time, because typically you forward the request to the people in your network, 
					and then these people forward as well, and so on.</li>
				</ul>
				Therefore we creates spine!<br><br>
				Spine is a social democratic crowd solution for your organisation. It works by tagging people by their expertise.
				Everyone can tag everyone and all together results in a transparent knowledge backbone of your organisation. Do
				not loose time in inefficient search for an expert. Start using spine!<br>

				We offer spine as a freemium model. This means that the basic functionality is free in case you use our hosted
				soluton (also called SaaS, Software-as-a-Service). When you want to install spine on your premise or want additional
				enterprise features like connectivity to your enterprise user directory, then we offer a yearly subscription fee,
				based upon the amount of users in your organisation.

				We are a young and dynamic start-up company. But we are very experienced people. Most of us are already for over 10
				years in professional life, mainly in the IT area. We have seen a lot and all our experience we have put into spine
				to make it very attractive and based upon most modern technologies.
